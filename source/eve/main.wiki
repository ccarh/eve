ZUNDER DEVELOPMENT

Electronic editions have diverse purposes and therefore pursue different avenues of development.  Most are open-ended: further development and refinement can be expected.  As pioneers, all share the possibility that changes in hardware, software, and internet protocols may necessitate changes of design and delivery methods.  Our listing is limited to open-access projects from which music may be downloaded and in some cases searched, analyzed, listened to, visualized, and re-edited.

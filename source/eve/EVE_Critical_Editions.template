Editions listed here cite curated scores, usually with a critical apparatus (a description of the musical sources and a log of differences between the present score and the original one).  Some offer performing parts or downloadable files from which parts can be created. Data files with which you can make your own edition of a score are included as appropriate.  Some sites are under development.  All are intended for expansion.  Please note that EVE is limited to open-access materials.

===MARGOT===

Website: [https://uwaterloo.ca/margot/margot-projects MARGOT]

MARGOT is focused on a range of interdisciplinary, intertextual, and intermedia projects including German adaptations of French &lt;i>chanson de geste&lt;/i>, the &lt;i>Roman de la rose&lt;/i> in text and image, and women writers in the &lt;i>ancien rÃ©gime&lt;/i>. Apart from being the home of the new CANTUS search engine (see [http://drm.ccarh.org/ DRM], 4.1.2), MARGOT is peripheral to most music study but complementary to certain musical topics of the medieval and early modern periods.  The site is being developed at the University of Waterloo in both French and English versions.

===Parzival (Digital Critical Edition)===

Website: [http://www.parzival.unibe.ch/englishpresentation.html Parzival (Digital Critical Edition)]

Owing to its long textual tradition (1210-1833) Wolfram von Eschenbach's medieval romance of the Arthurian knight &lt;i>Parzival&lt;/i> and his search for the Holy Grail has an exceptionally complex history. Its sources include 16 intact manuscripts, 77 fragments, and a print from 1477. The narrative weaves together fragments of several textual traditions. The value of a new digital edition incorporating principal sources will enable the study of intertextual relationships to other epics circulated in manuscript. Elements of the new project include the creation of a catalog of manuscripts and verse-by-verse annotations. Richard Wagner read a version of the work in 1845 and began to think about composing an opera on the subject in 1857, but his opera &lt;i>Parsifal&lt;/i> did not have its premiere until 1882.

A "play" button enables synthetic performance, which is highlighted in the on-screen score.
